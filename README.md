The file run_tests.sh is the "script" that we will use to run tests on your coding assignments. 

If you would like to test your code before submitting it, clone this repository and replace assignment01.cpp with your own program. Rename your program assignment01.cpp (or change the appropriate line in run_tests.sh) and then execute:

`bash run_tests.sh`

The output should look like this if you use the default assignment01.cpp file:

```
dperkins@Mac-24024 test_running % bash run_tests.sh
>>> running tests01/test01.txt
Here's the data from the input file:  3 6 4 5 2

>>> running tests01/test02.txt
Here's the data from the input file:  6 3 2 4 1 7 8
```
