The file `run_tests.sh` is the "script" that we will use to run tests on your code. The actual tests that we use may differ from the sample tests that are included in the folder `tests`. 

If you would like to test your code before submitting it, clone this repository and replace `assignment.cpp` with your own program. Rename your program `assignment.cpp` (or change the appropriate line in `run_tests.sh`) and then execute:

```
bash run_tests.sh
```
