The file `run_tests.sh` is the "script" that we will use to run tests on your coding assignments. 

If you would like to test your code before submitting it, clone this repository and replace `assignment01.cpp` with your own program. Rename your program `assignment01.cpp` (or change the appropriate line in `run_tests.sh`) and then execute:

```
bash run_tests.sh
```

The output should look like this if you use the default `assignment01.cpp` file:

```
>>> running tests01/test01.txt
Here's the data from the input file:  3 6 4 5 2

>>> running tests01/test02.txt
Here's the data from the input file:  6 13 2 4 11 7 18

>>> running tests01/test03.txt
Here's the data from the input file:  8 7 6 6 4 4 2 1 1
```

The output will change to whatever output you chose to include in your program.
