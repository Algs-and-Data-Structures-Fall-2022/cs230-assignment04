The file `run_tests.sh` is the "script" that we will use to run tests on your coding assignments. 

If you would like to test your code before submitting it, clone this repository and replace `assignment04.cpp` with your own program. Rename your program `assignment04.cpp` (or change the appropriate line in `run_tests.sh`) and then execute:

```
bash run_tests.sh
```
